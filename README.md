# Way of the Shield - a mod for the game Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous to make shields more enjoyable
And some other tweaks like flanking rules

This mod supports installation by both UMM and through Owlcat Modifications Manager. <b>Please, don't install it both ways! Having it installed twice is likely to cause unstable work!</b> The Modfinder support will be added soonâ„¢.
This mod has no dependencies on other mods; it does support ModMenu, but does not require it. 
This mod creates save dependency.

## This will not work on beta-branch!

## Highlights

-   Use your Heavy or Light shield actively in combat to get sizable bonus to AC by taking Two-Weapon Fighting penalties;
-   Use Bucklers or Light shields to parry incoming melee attacks by taking Two-Weapon Fighting penalties;
-   use Tower shields to grant yourself total cover as per table-top rules;
-   Unhindering Shield feat to let those magi, monks and duelists benefit from bucklers;
-   Upsetting Shield style to allow bashing with bucklers;
-   Get the ability to perform shield bash without the Improved Shield Bash feat.
-   New homebrew backstab mechanic - come to your enemies from behind to ignore their shield bonuses;
-   Flanking mechanic and soft cover rules faithful to tabletop rules as well as reworks to some teamwork feats to make those more impactful;
-   The comeback of the mechanic from Call of the Wild allowing to use two-handed weapons while equipped with shields. As well as Shield Brace feat and ability to use -   two-handed spears with shields while mounted;
-   It's now possible to equip shields, armor and weapon without the proficiency as per tabletop rules at the expense of attack bonus;
-   New Paladin Archetype from tabletop - Sacred Shield;

## Known bugs
-   Shield Focus feat applies its bonus twice. I may fix it at some point, but for now consider it a feature.
-   It's possible to bash with a buckler while holding a weapon two-handedly if you have both Unhindering Shield and Upsetting Shield. Will likely fix it out soon, but leave a setting to turn it back for people who'd like it.
